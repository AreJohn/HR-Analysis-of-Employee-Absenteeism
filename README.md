## Project Overview
##### This project explores employee absenteeism at UCI Global using SQL. The goal was to understand the underlying causes of frequent absences, identify at-risk groups, and offer data-driven HR recommendations to improve attendance and overall performance.

## Business Challenge
##### UCI Global's management is concerned about rising absenteeism and its impact on productivity. They suspect various factors like health, family demands, and workplace policy issues. As a data analyst, I was tasked with:
##### ‚Ä¢	Identifying absenteeism patterns
##### ‚Ä¢	Profiling high-risk employee groups
##### ‚Ä¢	Recommending HR strategies to improve attendance

## Tools 
|Tool | Purpose |
|----|----|
|SQL | Data cleaning and analysis |
|Excel | Visual storytelling and charts|
|PowerPoint | Final storytelling presentation |

## Data Source:
###### The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/445/absenteeism+at+work) contains two csv files:
###### 1.	Employees_info
###### 2.	Absenteeism_info

##### 1.	Employees_info:  This table includes data on individual employees, such as their unique ID, transport expense, distance from home to work, age, number of children, pet ownership, education level, social drinking, social smoking, weight, and height.
##### 2.	Absenteeism_info: This table contains data related to employee‚Äôs absence, including their ID, reason for absence (coded numerically), month of absence, day of the week, workload average per day, employee target hit, absenteeism time in hours, service time, and disciplinary failure.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation
#### Key data wrangling tasks using SQL:
##### 1. Joined employee & absence datasets: Combined both CSV files into a unified SQL table.
##### 2. Cleaned categorical columns: Translated codes into readable values (e.g., months, days, seasons).
##### 3. Calculated BMI: Derived BMI & grouped into Health Status.
##### 4. Coded Absence Reasons: Grouped 27 reasons into 4 main categories.
